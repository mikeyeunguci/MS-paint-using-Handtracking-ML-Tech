3. What online resources did you consult when completing this assignment? (list specific URLs)
When constructing the html canvas element and the draw tool, we consulted the following link:
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API
We also took a look at the provided handtracker.js documentation to help with handling custom gestures.
We also drew inspiration from demos shown in class.


4. What classmates or other individuals did you consult as part of this assignment? What did you discuss?
This assingment was a partner assingment and all work was done by Arnav Amin and Michael Yueng.

Have a good web camera!


--Aim for no more than two sentences for each of the following questions.--


6. Did you design your app with a particular type of user in mind? If so, whom?
There was no specific user in mind when creating this app. However, it was a creative approach to redesigning
MS paint using handtracking technology.

7. Describe the two custom gestures you created.
One custom gesture we created was one open hand and one closed hand. This gesture fills the canvas page with the current
color. We also implemented a swipe left and right gesture which detects sudden movement of a open or closed hand from 
one end of the screen to another. This gesture increases and decreases brush width.

8. How does your app implement or follow principles of good UI design?
The app's design in minimal, with a good use of margins and styling. There are clear instructions presented to the user
on how to use the app. With a prediction every 50 milliseconds, the app can track your hand movements reasonable and convert
the movements into actual drawings.
